            </section>
                <p>My name is Julian. I studied law and completed my first state exam in May 2021. Even during my studies, I enjoyed working in IT law due to my affinity for technology, including at large law firms such as Taylor Wessing or Osborne Clarke. With a large law firm focus on understanding not only the legal needs of clients, but also their business needs, the next logical step for me was to expand my knowledge in the field of economics. I was able to successfully fulfill this goal by obtaining the title "International Master of Business Administration" from Buckinghamshire New University in April 2023. In particular, issues around leadership and development of teams/employees, management of international projects as well as strategic business decisions were covered in the MBA program. At the same time, due to my previously mentioned affinity for technology, my interest in the field of technology has never waned. Particularly coupled with the desire to make the day-to-day work of a lawyer more efficient and even more service-oriented, I have thus been looking for further training opportunities in this area. This search led me to an LL.M. at the University of Regensburg, which I completed in December 2023. This master's program has focused intensively on legal implications of the topic as well as the possibility of using technology to make lawyers from all fields more efficient or relieve them in their daily work. The interests and wishes described above have also been reflected in my professional orientation. Since June 2022, I have been a research associate at Osborne Clarke Solutions, where I am primarily involved with topics related to the transformation of Osborne Clarke's legal services. My work at Osborne Clarke Solutions (OCS) involves dealing with legal, business and information technology issues. During my work at OCS, I found that answering questions in the information technology area often still posed difficulties for me, so to complete my profile I attended a three-month web development bootcamp and am now a certified web developer.</div>
